# WFDB Plus

This is NOT the WFDB software package. See https://github.com/bemoody/wfdb instead.

This is a project attempting to advance the WFDB package into a more modern form, by converting the main code into C++, refactoring and reorganizing the content, and using CMake as the build system generator. If this effort proves successful, this will become the reference WFDB package. If not, you never read this.

## Repo Content

- `src`: The main WFDB codebase.
- `data`: Data used for tests.
- `examples`: Example usage scripts.
- `fortran`: Fortran wrappers for the WFDB library.
- `wave`: The Linux desktop waveform viewer, WAVE.
